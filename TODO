I want to make this run on the open problems data first.

Then, I can make it work with larger atlases, like: 
atac-seq https://doi-org.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/10.1016/j.cell.2021.10.024

1. Move and rename open problems data here
2. Input data prep -
    a. check that the graph is connected
    b. check that atac is connected to rest of graph
    c. check degree distribution
    d. betweeness
3. Setup architecture
    a. One neural net per node
